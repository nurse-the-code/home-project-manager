# Home Project Manager :house:

A project management app for families, small groups, and individuals :family:

## Directory Structure

- `./server/` - Backend server and database code.
- `./webclient/` - Web client code (may add additional clients in future).

Each of these directories has its own README with more specific instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH:
   - **HTTPS** (more user-friendly, may prompt for username and password or personal access token):
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/nurse-the-code/home-project-manager.git
     ```
   - **SSH** (better security, requires an SSH key added to your GitHub account):
     ```
     git clone git@github.com:nurse-the-code/home-project-manager.git
     ```
2. Navigate to the `./server/` directory and follow the instructions in the README.
3. Navigate to the `./webclient/` directory and follow the instructions in the README.

Happy project managing! :tada:
